**TOPIC**: Automate maintenance of Lambda functions by identifying and updating outdated runtimes.

This project helps you automatically detect and update AWS Lambda functions that are using outdated runtimes ‚Äî like python3.9 or nodejs12.x ‚Äî and upgrade them to supported versions such as python3.11 or nodejs20.x.

Whether you're preparing for AWS deprecation deadlines or maintaining security compliance, this tool ensures your Lambda functions stay up-to-date with minimal effort.

# Why Runtime Upgrades Matter

AWS periodically deprecates old runtimes. Continuing to use them can lead to:

‚ùå Inability to create new functions or update existing ones.

üõë Removal of critical security patches and updates.

‚ö†Ô∏è Application outages if AWS drops support unexpectedly.

# üîç Features

- Lists all Lambda functions in an AWS region.

- Filters for outdated runtimes.

- Supports dry-run mode.

- Generates `before.json` and `after.json` reports.

- Includes logging and CLI flags.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Runtime Support Policy

AWS regularly deprecates older Lambda runtimes. When a runtime is deprecated:

- You can no longer create new functions using it.

- You must update existing functions before they are removed.

- Deprecated runtimes eventually stop receiving security updates.

# Output Reports

After execution, two JSON files are generated in /tmp (in Lambda) or your local system:

before.json: List of outdated functions with their current runtimes.

after.json: List of updated functions and new runtimes applied.

Example: 

[
  {
    "FunctionName": "imageProcessor",
    "OldRuntime": "python3.9",
    "NewRuntime": "python3.11"
  }
]

# Deploy as an AWS Lambda Function

Package the script as a Lambda.

Set the handler to upgrade_runtime.lambda_handler.

Schedule it using EventBridge (cron).

Check CloudWatch Logs for detailed output.
